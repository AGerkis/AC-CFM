# AC-CFM
AC cascading failure model based on MATPOWER for resilience analysis of power networks.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The following steps will guide you through getting AC-CFM run on your computer.

### Prerequisites

* Matlab 2019a or later is recommended to run AC-CFM.

* Matpower 7.1 or later is required to run AC-CFM. Please follow the [instructions on the Matpower Website for installation](https://matpower.org/about/get-started/).

* IPOPT is recommended to install, as it tends to have higher convergence for AC optimal power flows. Instructions on how to install IPOPT can be found [on the Matpower website](https://matpower.org/download/optional-solvers/). The [OPTI Toolbox](https://www.inverseproblem.co.nz/OPTI/) is a simple way of installing IPOPT.

* Test the installation of Matpower and IPOPT by running the following command in Matlab:
```
runopf(case9, mpoption('opf.ac.solver', 'IPOPT'))
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mnoebels/AC-CFM.git
```
2. Add the AC-CFM folder to your Matlab path setting (menu Home -> Set Path)



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use the following example to model the cascade following a single line outage in the IEEE 39-bus test network:
```
% load default settings
settings = get_default_settings();
 
% enable verbose output â€“ just for testing
settings.verbose = 1;
 
% model outage of line 9
initial_contingency = 9;
 
% apply the model
result = accfm(case39, struct('branches', initial_contingency), settings);
```
This should produce the following output:
```

<!-- Troubleshooting -->
## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems, for instance exceptionally large load shedding or large amount of OPF load shedding, try the following:

1. Set PMIN (column 10) of the gen matrix to zero.
2. Increase the reactive power limits (columns 4 and 5) of the gen matrix (e.g. to +80% and -40% of PMAX).
3. Loads should be fixed (not dispatchable) before passed to AC-CFM. You can use the disp2load function provided to convert dispatchable loads to fixed loads.
