# AC-CFM
AC cascading failure model based on MATPOWER for resilience analysis of power networks. Largely copied from the the [original repo](https://github.com/mnoebels/AC-CFM) with minor bug fixes and the addition of more detailed outputs for analysis of the cascading process.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The following steps will guide you through getting AC-CFM run on your computer.

### Prerequisites

* Matlab 2019a or later is recommended to run AC-CFM.

* Matpower 7.1 or later is required to run AC-CFM. Please follow the [instructions on the Matpower Website for installation](https://matpower.org/about/get-started/).

* IPOPT is recommended to install, as it tends to have higher convergence for AC optimal power flows. Instructions on how to install IPOPT can be found [on the Matpower website](https://matpower.org/download/optional-solvers/). The [OPTI Toolbox](https://www.inverseproblem.co.nz/OPTI/) is a simple way of installing IPOPT.

* Test the installation of Matpower and IPOPT by running the following command in Matlab:
```
runopf(case9, mpoption('opf.ac.solver', 'IPOPT'))
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mnoebels/AC-CFM.git
```
2. Add the AC-CFM folder to your Matlab path setting (menu Home -> Set Path)



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Single contingency

Use the following example to model the cascade following a single contingency (here: failure of line 9 in the IEEE 39-bus test network):
```
% load default settings
settings = get_default_settings();
 
% enable verbose output â€“ just for testing
settings.verbose = 1;
 
% model outage of line 9; this can also be an array of branch indices
initial_contingency = 9;
 
% apply the model
result = accfm(case39, struct('branches', initial_contingency), settings);
```
This should produce the following output:
```
  Demand increased by 0.1% (limit is 15.0%) and generation capacity is met. Distribute slack generation.

### Batch processing

AC-CFM comes with two routines that can be used for batch processing of large numbers of contingencies, depending if the contingencies are known, or whether they should be sampled from a probability distribution. Both functions make use of the parallel processing capabilities of Matlab using parfor loops.

If the contingencies are known, the following code runs AC-CFM on the specified network for every contingency specified in scenarios. scenarios is a cell array.

```result = accfm_branch_scenarios(network, scenarios, settings)```

It returns a struct containing the results, tripped buses, lines, generators, etc. for each contingency.

If contingencies should be sampled from a probability distribution, use the following code. pdf is the name of a probability distribution (at the moment, only "zipf" is implemented). alpha is the exponent of the Zipf distribution. number_of_scenarios specified the number of contingencies to be sampled. If output_file is specified, the results are saved in a file with the given filename.

```result = accfm_pdf_batch(network, pdf, alpha, number_of_scenarios, settings, output_file)```


### Settings

Behavior of AC-CFM can be adjusted via the settings struct.

Load default settings:
```settings = get_default_settings();```

The following options are available:

* verbose (0 or 1): If set to 0, suppress model output.

* mpopt: Matpower options struct. Please refer to the Matpower docs for details.

* max_recursion_depth (integer): Maximum recursion depth. An error is thrown if this is reached and the cascade has still not come to an end.

* uvls_per_step (0 to 1): Ratio of load that is shed per UVLS step.

* uvls_max_steps (integer): Maximum number of UVLS steps before all loads at a bus are tripped.

* dP_limit (0 to 1): Maximum generation imbalance before UFLS is applied.

* P_overhead (0 to 1): Ratio of generation overhead when applying UFLS, mainly to meet transmission losses.

* Q_tolerance (0 to 1): Ratio of reactive power limits that can be exceeded before O/UXL is applied.

* grid_forming (cell array): Generator types (see Matpower function `gentypes`) that have grid-forming capability. Every island needs to have at least one grid-forming generator. Requires that the network struct contains a field `gentypes`. Set to empty to ignore requirement for grid-forming generators.

* keep_networks_after_cascade (0 or 1): In batch processing, keep final network struct for each contingency. This significantly increases required memory.

<!-- Troubleshooting -->
## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems, for instance exceptionally large load shedding or large amount of OPF load shedding, try the following:

1. Set PMIN (column 10) of the gen matrix to zero to disable minimum power output limits of generators.
2. Increase the reactive power limits (columns 4 and 5) of the gen matrix (e.g. to +80% and -40% of PMAX).
3. Loads should be fixed (not dispatchable) before passed to AC-CFM. You can use the disp2load function provided to convert dispatchable loads to fixed loads.
